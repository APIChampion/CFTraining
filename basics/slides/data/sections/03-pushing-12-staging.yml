    **Buildpacks** create a runnable artifact called a **droplet**

    ```sh
    App Files + Runtime Dependencies = App Artifact (droplet)
    ```

    <i class="fa fa-tint" style="font-size: 150px; margin-top: 50px;"></i>
  </span>

notes: |

  The output of the staging phase is an executable artifact called a 'droplet'.
  Droplets are constructed by Buildpacks (more in the next section).
