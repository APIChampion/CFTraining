  **Embrace failure** & run **many instances** of the same app

  ```sh
  $ cf scale imperfect-app -i 3
  $ cf apps

  name            state     instances
  imperfect-app   started   2/3         
  ```

notes: |

  Because CF is running your app, running many instances of it is just a command away. The more app instances you have, the less likely that they will be running on the same host
