  *Where should my app store state?*

  <i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size: 120px;"> </i>

  **In an external service**.

  </span>

columnRightContent: |

  - Horizontal **scale** (adding instances)
  - Eliminate costly **routing** overhead (*sticky sessions are supported*)
  - Leverage services in the **marketplace**

notes: |

  Apps need state.  In order for apps to scale horizontally, handle failure, simplify routing apps should store state in an external service (like a database)
