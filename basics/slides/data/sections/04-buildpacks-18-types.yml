  * Default buildpacks (included in the platform)
  * [Community](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki/Buildpacks) buildpacks: Leverage the community
  * Custom buildpacks: Build your own

notes: |
  Platform ships with buildpacks.  You will see which ones are on PWS in the lab.  The community is also developing buildpacks.
  Or build your own - your language deserves its own buildpack (complexity is up to you).
