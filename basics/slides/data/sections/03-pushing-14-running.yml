  **Apps** are started on specialized VMs called **cells**

  * If it's a web process, it binds to a **TCP port**
  * Instances are **distributed** across multiple cells
  * **Router** distributes traffic across instances

notes: |

  Apps are run inside containers on cells.  If multiple instances are pushed, they are distributed across cells.  Traffic is routed automatically.
