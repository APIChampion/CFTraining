  **Health Management Components:**

  * **nsync**: gets message from CC (after `cf scale`). Writes the `DesiredLRP` value in BBS.

  * **Cell Rep** Monitors containers to get the `ActualLRP` value

  * **BBS**: Monitors `DesiredLRP` vs `ActualLRP` and kills/launches instances.



notes:

  This is what happens behind the scenes of a cf scale
