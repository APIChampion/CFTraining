This course is designed to give its students a hands on experience of designing applications for Cloud Foundry. We will give an overview of Cloud Foundry and its tools from the point of view of an application developer and how to architect polyglot applications for deployment and scaling in the cloud.

This training is targeted at developers with little hands-on Cloud Foundry experience and those who have an interest in deploying innovative, microservice-based systems into the cloud.
