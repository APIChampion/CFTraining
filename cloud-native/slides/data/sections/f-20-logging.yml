notes: |
  What if the problem is one single instance or some other CF component?

  How to you get logs today?  Lots of instances, components (like the router), etc.

  This is a complicated picture.  The important takeaways:

    * CF aggregates logs across instances and CF components
    * Exporting to an external analysis system like Splunk, Papertrail, ELK is trivial.
