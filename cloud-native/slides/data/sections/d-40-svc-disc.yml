  Client Side load-balancing

notes: |

  Service discovery leverages a fault tolerant, distributed and scalable registry.  The registry allows services to self register and client to find instances of services.
  Client side load-balancing allows clients to directly connect, removing the single point of failure in many ESB solutions.
