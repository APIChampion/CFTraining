notes: |

  Here is what you should already have experienced (or could experience).

  * Strictly separate build and run stages - What happened when you pushed an app?
  * Export services via port binding - Svc is accessible via REST over HTTP
  * Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible - in cf, orgs and spaces don't change the execution environment.
